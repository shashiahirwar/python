#Variable Names
#A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

#Rules for Python variables:

#A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
#A variable name cannot start with a number
#A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
#Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
#A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
